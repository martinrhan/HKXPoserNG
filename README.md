HKXPoserNG is a successor and rework of the old hkxPoser. Until today, animation modders are using cumbersome and outdated toolchains, that they need to go through a lot of weird processes and many very old software.  With HKXPoserNG, I am willing to provide modders with a unified and organized modding experience and the long-term goal is to be featured enough to replace any other tool needed to create or modify animation mods.
